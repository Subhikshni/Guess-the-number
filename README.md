## Introduction

Guess My Number is a game where the player tries to guess a secret number between 1 and 100. The game provides feedback to the player on whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct. The player's score decreases with each incorrect guess, and their highscore is tracked throughout the game session.

## Features

- Allow the player to input guesses and check if they are correct.
- Provide feedback to the player on whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- Update the player's score and highscore.
- Allow the player to play again with a new secret number.

## Usage
